# go-auth

This project comes from the curiosity of decomposing auth service. Looking to tackle the following actions:

- Creating a user
- Generate Token via username and password
- Validating Token
- Authorizing Action

This implementation is to be written in Go with the ability to run locally using Docker.

## Open Questions:
- Salt and or Pepper on passwords?
- What would the effort look like to include OAUTH?
- What tradeoffs would you consider when rolling auth or Saas?
